When your store is growing it could be pretty difficult to manage inventory and orders effectively.  Try to improve your workflow by printing barcode labels for your products. 
Printed labels can contain various product information which helps to understand the basic details about the product.
And the barcode (on the label) allows to get all the product information from WooCommerce using your POS system.
In combination with our [Barcode Scanner](https://wordpress.org/plugins/barcode-scanner-lite-pos-to-manage-products-inventory-and-orders/) plugin, you can scan the barcode and get all the basic product details to manage inventory as fast as possible. And the mobile app allows to scan the barcode and manage your inventory right from the smartphone.

* Print barcode labels for your existing products, purchased items or create & print labels manualy.

== Possible use cases ==

### Printing barcode labels for existing products

Plugin allows to create labels for existing products. 
You can print labels (with or without the barcode) in 4 different ways:
* "All Products" page - you can check/select a few products and then press "Product Label" button at the top of the product list.
* "All products" page - create label for 1 specific product by clicking on "Label" icon near each product in the product list.
* "Product edit" page - you will find button "Product Label" above product description for the current product.
* "Product edit" page - you will find buttons "Product Label" for each variation in the "Variations" section.

### Printing barcode labels for purchased items

Use this plugin to create labels for purchased items in the order.
There 3 ways to create such labels:
* "Orders" page - check/select one or a few orders and press "Product Label" button at the top of he order list.
* "Inner Order" page - Open one specific order and press "Product Label" button on the right hand side (in a widgets section).
* "Inner Order" page - Each purchased item has a "Select" checkbox which you can mark and then press "Create Product Labels" button below the purchased items.

### Scanning the barcodes

The barcodes on the labels can be scanned by various software. You may already have some barcode scanning plugin (or POS system) which will allow you to scan and manage the products/orders.
However, if you don't have such plugin yet, we recomend you to use our lite [Barcode Scanner](https://wordpress.org/plugins/barcode-scanner-lite-pos-to-manage-products-inventory-and-orders/) plugin for fast and effective inventory/order managment. With this plugin you simply scan the barcode and associated product or order will be shown to you in a few seconds. And the iOS/Android app will allow you to do so from the smartphone.

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= I have label sheets and I am not sure if this plugin can support it. =

By default bar-code generator contains the most popular A4 label sheets that allows to print 12, 14, 16, 21, 24, 40, 44, 56, 65, 120, 189, 230 or 324 barcodes per page.
If you have label sheet with different amount of labels or with different sizes - you can easily create your own custom format - just specify sizes of labels, margins, label gaps and new format will be ready for work.

= How to put attributes or custom fields on bar-code label ? =

By default plugin allows to display on barcode 2 attributes/custom fields. For this you need to match "Text1" and "Text2" fields on "Import" popup with specific attribute or custom field. To use 3 or more attributes/custom fields on barcode you will have to create new barcode template and by using shortcodes like **[attr=gcolor]** or **[cf=_regular_price]** specify where they should be placed. The value for shortcode might look different, like "tshirt_size", "upc_code" or "my_custom_field". Usually name of custom field or attribute is specified in plugin/place where it was created.

= How do I know that my printer supports margin-free printing ? =

Before printing it's very important to get to know your printer a little bit better, especially we need to know if printer can print without page margins.

The right way to do it is to read technical documentation about your printer (or find it in google) but if you lost documentation or can't find in google there is another way. 

Print [this PDF page](https://www.ukrsolution.com/pdf/Barcodes/Check-Printer-Margins.pdf) and compare if it looks the same as on PDF. If page border doesn't look the same - your printer might not suport border-free printing or you didn't check this option in print settings popup.

= My printer doesn't support margin-free printing, what's next ? =

It's ok, actually most of printers can't do it. You just need to use label sheets with page margins. 

[Here is example](https://www.ukrsolution.com/pdf/Barcodes/label-sheet-40-margins.pdf) of label sheet (40 labels per page) with page margins.

= What types of bar-codes do you support ? =

Our **Bar-code Generator** supports most popular types of codes: **CODE128**, **UPC**, **EAN**, **EAN8**, **CODE39**, **EAN13**, **QRCode** and **DataMatrix**.

= Can I save/download barcodes on my MAC or PC? =

There are 2 ways: 
1. You can save each code as PNG image.
2. You can save all pages as PDF document, so you will be able to print them later.

= How much barcodes I can  put on page ? =

As much as you need :)
Our barcode generator contains buil-in set of the most popular A4 label sheets which allows to add 12, 14, 16, 21, 24, 56 or 65 barcodes per page.
And you can create any amount of your own label sheet formats.

= How can I generate barcodes for all products in particular category or categories ? =

Please follow these steps:
1. Click at "Barcode Generator" -> "Import categories" menu.
2. Check categories for which you'd like to create barcodes, specify barcode type and fields you'd like to use for barcode generation.
3. Click "Import" button.
 

= Can I add  product name on barcode ? =

Sure, one barcode can contain and code and product name.

= I have found a bug, how can it be fixed ? =

You need to send email to us and provide us with details:
How to reproduce bug
Screenshots of bug
Best way to describe the problem is to create video (you can use software like Jing)

= Can I add a prefix to a barcode code ? = 

Sure, this option available on the settings page.

= Can I combine values for generating code ?= 

Yes, our plugin supports this option which you can find on the "custom template" page (the [code] value tab).
